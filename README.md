Developer-Oriented Digital Game Engine

After failing to find a virtual tabletop framework/engine/program to help devlop and prototype boardgames, I decided to design my own

Core Requirements:

Modular design that attempts to reduce the number of core game objects

MVC approach to allow multiple views of the same basic data

Simple Data structures that can be exported in plain text and easily imported

Replay mode that can export existing games or import modified history logs or even allow history to be modified in-game

Layer based approach to Play Area creation and interaction

Music and sound effect triggers

Simple automation

Batch interface/API
